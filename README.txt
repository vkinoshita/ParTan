- This is an basic implementation of Bazaraa's ParTan that finds the minimum of almost all n dimensional functions.

- Both implementations, Partan and Linear Search, works pretty well. 

- The Penalty method is a little bit rudimentary. It means that sometimes you will not get the real optimal value. So, don't trust the partan_with_restriction.py.

- The partan's report is written in portuguese.
